# Google Fit integration sample app

This is a simple template to help anyone who may be trying to display the Google Fit data from within their app.

## What it does

It displays both the steps and distance data recorded on the Google Fit app for today's date

## What you should do to run this code

Make sure you copy the debug.key file committed to the project to your .android folder replacing your corrent debug.keystore

PS: The .android folder is usually located within c/users/username

## Issues I would love your help with

The app currently displays the distance data as a total of walking + (running + cycling + etc). 
I would love to be able to get the walked distance only.

Issue logged on SO under https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50736500/google-fit-walked-distance-only-not-total-walking-cycling-running

## Things you should know about
This project was added to the Google Fit console (SHA1 key and package name). If you happen to rename the package 
(or I delete the project on the console.. hehe/ooops) you may need to do that step yourself under https://console.developers.google.com
